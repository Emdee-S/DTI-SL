the dgl library (for graphing) is outdated?
Regardless, dgllife needs rdkit and dgl


DGL (Deep Graph Library): A flexible Python library for building and training graph neural networks (GNNs).
DGL-LifeSci (dgllife): A DGL extension with prebuilt GNN models and utilities for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.
RDKit: A powerful cheminformatics toolkit for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing chemical structures.

These are def needed

    pip install dgl
    pip install rdkit
    pip install dgllife
    from dgllife.model.gnn import GCN

these might be needed, the environment is acting strange.. maybe we dont need them
